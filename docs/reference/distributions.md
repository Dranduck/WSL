# Distributions
Our flagship distribution is Ubuntu. This is the one that is installed by default when you install WSL for the first time. However, we develop several flavors. It may be the case that one or more of these flavors fits your needs better.

Each of these flavors corresponds to a different application on the Microsoft Store, and once installed, they'll create different distros in your WSL. These are the applications we develop and maintain:
- [Ubuntu](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PDXGNCFSCZV?hl=en-us&gl=US) ships the latest stable LTS release of Ubuntu. When new LTS versions are released, Ubuntu can be upgraded once the first point release is available.
- [Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PNKSF5ZN4SW?hl=en-us&gl=US), [Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9MTTCL66CPXJ?hl=en-us&gl=US), and [Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PN20MSR04DW?hl=en-us&gl=US) are the LTS versions of Ubuntu and receive updates for five years. Upgrades to future LTS releases will not be proposed.
- [Ubuntu (Preview)](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9P7BDVKVNXZ6?hl=en-us&gl=US) is a daily build of the latest development version of Ubuntu previewing new features as they are developed. It does not receive the same level of QA as stable releases and should not be used for production workloads.
